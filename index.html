  <h1>Owen Chen - The Farting Superhero</h1>
  <p>Hello there! My name is Owen Chen, and I'm a superhero with a unique power - I can fart to save the day! That's right, I may not have super strength or the ability to fly, but I can let out some seriously potent farts that can knock out villains and save the day.</p>

  <p>I know, I know - it's not the most glamorous superpower. But hey, it works! And let me tell you, it's come in handy more times than I can count. Just imagine being able to take down a group of baddies without even lifting a finger - it's pretty cool, if you ask me.</p>
  <p>But don't just take my word for it. Here are some testimonials from people I've saved:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"I was being held hostage by a group of armed robbers, but then Owen Chen came in and let out a fart that knocked them all unconscious. It was amazing!" - Sarah, saved from certain doom</p>
    <p>"I was trapped in a burning building, but Owen Chen's fart was so powerful it blew out the walls and saved me!" - John, grateful survivor</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Of course, there are some downsides to my powers. For one, I have to be careful not to fart too much, or I might accidentally blow up a building. And let's be real, no one wants to be around a guy who's constantly farting. But hey, it's a small price to pay for being a superhero, right?</p>
  <p>So there you have it - I may not be the most conventional superhero out there, but I'm doing my part to save the world, one fart at a time. Thanks for stopping by my page, and remember - if you ever need help, just give me a call and I'll be there in a fart.</p>
